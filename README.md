# TM470 - Change Your Name Project
## About
This was my project for my Open University module TM470, 
serving as the final module for my degree.  The code generated
here is for my final working prototype, designed to work locally
on a machine to run through with users.

## Technical Details
This project was designed using Python 3.7.4.

The following projects are listed in the requirements file and 
are needed to make the prototype function:
* Flask (1.1.2) 
  * This is used to run the mock web server and route the HTTP
  requests.
* Werkzeug (1.0.1)
* setuptools (49.1.0)
